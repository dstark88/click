I created a React.js application using Create-React-App.
This application renders 12 different images of nature on the screen. Each image listens for a click event. On click the application checks to see if the picture has been clicked before or not. It the image has not been clicked on the user gets one point and the images randomly shuffle. If the image has been clicked on the user loses and their score is checked aginst their best score. If the new score is higher the best score is updated. If not the best score remains the same. The user is trying to get all 12 images clicked without clicking one a second time.
